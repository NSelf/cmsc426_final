State: commit d8573f0 from Mary
Steps:

Ran code, validated that RANSAC followed by radial exclusion provides good results.

Attempted to run radial before RANSAC to speed up the process, ran into unsatisfactory results when RANSAC removed a plane of the forground.
Changing radius so that we can change the order, improve efficiency.

Changed some variable names, started the cropping of r, g, b wehnever we crop the 3D point sets so that we can use RGB data later.

END RESULT: Noise suppression now perfected for scene 1, efficient runtime by doing radial exclusion, then RANSAC, then average distance point removal over 2 std.

NEXT OBJECTIVEL: ICP
